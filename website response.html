The Website is a Documentary piece on how climate change is affecting the marshall islands. It combines video and text into an interactive slide show. This form of storytelling was very powerful because I was able to go through it at my own pace and had time to think and digest the information. Furthermore Id argue that this form of information delivery is better than video or text alone. Text today is the foundation of information however it has some drawbacks such as, it can be hard to imagine and understand what's being conveyed, and honestly can be very boring at times, especially historical and academic texts. That's why many students like video better. Everyone remembers the feeling of excitement when the teacher would bring out the the school TV. But Video also has drawbacks, the main one is it continues to play. Typical Documentary videos continue to play even if you get distracted this means you miss information. Kinda like climate change in how we pay attention to it only sometimes, but that doesn't mean it stops and waits for us to care again. The Last Generation combines video and text together taking the strengths of the media formats to combat their weaknesses. The website the delivers the information efficiently and effectively and I appreciate the effort it took to create it.
