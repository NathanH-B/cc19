			1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing communication methods for limited audiences? This can address the use, misuse, or lack of use of written language, technology, or visual design as forms of communication.

To answer Butlers question on a future without literacy. I think it's interesting. On one hand, reading and writing is more difficult, the brain has to do more decoding. The question is will computers do this decoding for use one day. For example the phones we carry on us we use for math all the time. Nobody gets a piece of paper and does some long division to figure out something. Matter a fact there are apps that can do much more complex math for you. I think someday the technology will exist where all we have to do is think about what we want to write and it will do it for use. And if we want to read something we just look at a block of text and instantly comprehend it. But thats so far away and reading and writing so far has always been the foundation of higher level communication if you forgo that ability to read and write and let a machine do it for you, you lose a lot of power. And there will always be some people who know how to do it to keep the system running.

			2. As so-called “digital natives”, where do you see literacy (of language, image, culture, tech, etc.) valued and/or devalued on the Web or amongst users of the Web? Are there notable advantages or disadvantages of any perceived shifts in recent years?

I think there has been a massive shift towards video formats for information. It used to be if you wanted to learn how to do something you would read an article about it. Know you watch a youtube tutorial. Us digital natives hate long articles. And really anything that takes a lot of time. We have developed shorter attention spans. Or more like we demand things to be faster. We like to get our information in short bursts. Instead of buying a book on how to fly a kite. We watch a 5 minute video. I think in some ways wanting information faster and more quickly is a gond thing. Many things can be explained much faster in fewer words. This puts a lot of pressure on content creators though. Arguability writing a short article on how to fly a kite is quicker there making a video. To write something you can do it anywhere at anytime and all you have to do is write it down. For a video, you have to go out film, make sure the lighting is right, Take multiple takes. Have a script, and edit. It takes so much longer to make a video but at the end it's easier to understand.

			3. How do you see the expanding or limiting nature of hypertext on today's Web? Do Delany's criticisms of hypertext still hold true within the modern Web and all of its growth and advancements

		</H4>
<H4>
		
I agree with Denalys opinion that all texts are hypertexts. That if you see something you don't understand a word you can look it up in the dictionary. All that hypertext does is do the work for you. However this is concerning because hypertext can be used in an academic or news setting to control the narrative. For example if you are reading an article about astronomy and there is a piece of hypertext about the earth that links you to a flat earth conspiracy article someone who is just starting to learn about the planets could get misinformed...or exposed to the truth depending on who you ask. Jokes aside hypertext can be helpful and used in creative ways especially in nonlinear novels but people need to keep in mind that hypertext links can be often biased and purposely there to prove the authors point.

			4. Are there any technological or societal speculations mentioned in this conversation that have come to be realized in the 11 years since these statements were made? Any that you see as irrelevant?

Butler's comments on video games and how they are starting to take over comics in the sense that it used to be comics that people viewed as bad for your brain and now its video games. Additionally how video games have gotten increasingly more violent and it seems like every year younger and younger kids are getting into violent video games. Now comics are viewed almost just as good as the books I recall in highschool having the option to pick certain comic books to do book reports on 11 years ago that wouldn't have been the case. One day video games may be looked upon the same way, hated by parents and teachers at first but then loved because of the next thing is much worse.
