			The Last Generation

The Website is a Documentary piece on how climate change is affecting the marshall islands. It combines video and text into an interactive slide show. This form of storytelling was very powerful because I was able to go through it at my own pace and had time to think and digest the information. Furthermore Id argue that this form of information delivery is better than video or text alone. Text today is the foundation of information however it has some drawbacks such as, it can be hard to imagine and understand what's being conveyed, and honestly can be very boring at times, especially historical and academic texts. That's why many students like video better. Everyone remembers the feeling of excitement when the teacher would bring out the the school TV. But Video also has drawbacks, the main one is it continues to play. Typical Documentary videos continue to play even if you get distracted this means you miss information. Kinda like climate change in how we pay attention to it only sometimes, but that doesn't mean it stops and waits for us to care again. The Last Generation combines video and text together taking the strengths of the media formats to combat their weaknesses. The website the delivers the information efficiently and effectively and I appreciate the effort it took to create it.

			Superbad, Ben Benjamin, 1997

Up until this class I never heard of web art before. I always thought a website has to serve a purpose. Not to say that Superbad doesn't have a purpose but its purpose is abstract in nature. What I like about Ben, Benjamins Superbad is the work is more than just a stagnant image on the web or even a moving one, it has depth. As you click through it transports you to new pages, each on their own a work of art. Each page has multiple hidden links bringing you to the next one making an infinite loop with many possibilities. The order you go through the pages influences the experience because the energy of each page can be so different. Like jumping in a hot tub and then immediately diving into snow. There is a certain amount of trust you have to have with the page as well. Typically when your on the internet if you see a link or clickable button that you don't recognize its usually in you best interest not to click it. The whole time I was thinking about what happens if someone where to hide some malware on the site you wouldn't even know until it's too late. Kinda like putting your hand in a dark hole that has a shimmering light at the bottom. Your curiosity pushes you to explore further but there could be a snake in the shadows.

			White collar crime risk zones 
		</H4>
<H4>
		
This website shares an interesting perspective crime zones. Typically crime zones are defined by street crime. Street crime is one of the factors that dictates in the real estate market value of a property. Ironically according to the map many of the places with the highest white collar crime has some of the highest property values in the region. The website defines a white collar crime being crimes that are “committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation” I think as it stands The website is very strong and has a powerful message however, when reading there white page im growing concern for there proposal on using the data on white collar crime to make software that can predict crimes. Additionally the most likely offender feature which would digitally generated a picture of the offending based on linked in profile pictures. These features seem very far fetched. Predicting crimes based on generalizations and limited data is a slippery slope. I don't think this feature would be helping the criminal justice system, especially if it were to be adopted to street crimes.
