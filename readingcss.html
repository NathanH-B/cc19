1.You don’t need to commit to memorizing every CSS Property and Value, as there are good places to look them up.
<br>
2.A selector does what it says on the tin, it selects some part of the document in order that you can apply CSS rules to it.
<br>
3.The cascade defines which rule wins when a number of rules could apply to one element.
<br>
4.CSS is all about boxes. Everything that is displayed on the screen has a box, and the Box Model describes how the size of that box is worked out — taking into account margins, padding, and borders.
<br>
5.If you find yourself in a situation where CSS seems to be doing something very strange, ask why. Create a reduced test case that highlights the issue.
